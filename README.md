Enjoy playing Wordle, but wish you could play as many games in one day as you wished? Well, look no further than this simple implementation of a command line Wordle replica! 

To play, all you need to do is enter the directory with the code, and call the following command:
```
./play
```

The code used to retrieve the set of words can be found in `word_gatherer.py`, and should work on any Unix-based machine!
